        <button class="accordion">What is mobile ordering?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Mobile ordering is a new feature of the Coffict Coffee app, enabling you to place and pay for an order at a nearby Coffict Coffee right from your phone and then collect it in-store.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Is mobile ordering available in all Coffict Coffee stores?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Mobile ordering is now available at over 500 Coffict Coffee stores nationwide. Keep an eye out for more stores coming soon.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Why don't I see all the menu items on the Coffict Coffee app menu?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>We currently offer nearly all of our most popular menu board drinks and a large range of our favourite food items. The range will be regularly reviewed and updated.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">I have a plastic card and the app; can I carry on using my plastic card when i place a mobile order?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, you are still able to use your plastic card as well as the app.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Are there any payment cards that you don't accept as payment with mobile ordering?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Unfortunately, we can’t accept American Express or any non-UK cards to pay for mobile orders.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Do I need a WiFi or 3G/4G connection to place a mobile order?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>If you’re placing an order and making a payment through the app, you’ll need to ensure you have a 3G, 4G, or WiFi connection.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">When will my mobile order be ready?</button>
        <div class="panel">

        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">I'm running late; can I change my mobile order?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Unfortunately, once your order is submitted, it can't be changed. If your order hasn’t been collected within 15 minutes of the estimated delivery time, it will be disposed of and can no longer be collected. You will not be refunded.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Where do I go in store to collect my order?</button>

        <div class="panel">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reformulate</strong> means we will redevelop a products recipe to remove added sugar.</li>
                <li><strong>Remove</strong> means we will de-list products (in their entirety) and replace with an alternative where possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommend Alternative</strong> means we will develop new products to offer healthier choices.</li>

        <button class="accordion">How much sugar are you reducing from the portfolio?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>As one part of our commitment to offering a nutritionally balanced menu and a range of healthier choices for customers, we will reduce added sugar in our drinks range by 25% by 2020, with 30% of added sugar being removed from our ice range.<br><br>It’s worth noting that only 32% of our drinks contain added sugar (including cappuccino which has an optional chocolate dusting).</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Why aren't you reducing added sugar in all drinks that contain it?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>We want to give our customers a wide range and choice in partnership with proactive added sugar reduction. This process is on-going and as we get feedback from our customers we’ll continue to proactively reduce added sugar across our portfolio without compromising on taste.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Which products are having their added sugar content reduced?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Working towards 2020, our product development, technical and supplier teams will review all of our drinks with added sugar. A plan is in place to either remove, reformulate or have a credible alternative for each drink, whilst offering more choice to consumers, including sugar-free syrups and milk alternatives.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">Why don't you make healhier products cheaper than non healthier products?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>As a business, we can’t subsidise customers’ choices, and we equally don’t charge a premium for healthy choices, our pricing is determined by a cost of sourcing and production among other operating overheads.</p>
